## Building locally

 - Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 8.11.3 and npm version 6.1.0
   - If you are using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) (recommended) running `nvm use` will automatically choose the right node version for you.
   - Select npm 6.1.0: ```npm install -g npm@6.1.0```
 - Install dependencies: ```npm install```
 - Install gulp globally with `npm install -g gulp-cli`.
 - Build the project to the `./dist/` folder with `gulp build`.
 - Optionally, to rebuild on file changes, run `gulp dev`.
 - To package .zip files for distribution, run `gulp zip`, or run the full build & zip with `gulp dist`.

 Uncompressed builds can be found in `/dist`, compressed builds can be found in `/builds` once they're built.

### Running Tests

Requires `mocha` installed. Run `npm install -g mocha`.

Then just run `npm test`.

You can also test with a continuously watching process, via `npm run watch`.

You can run the linter by itself with `gulp lint`.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## Build for Publishing

```bash
npm run dist
```

#### Writing Browser Tests

To write tests that will be run in the browser using QUnit, add your test files to `test/integration/lib`.
