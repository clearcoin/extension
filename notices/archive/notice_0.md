## 13. Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver ##

PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT

### 13.1 Initial Dispute Resolution ###

The parties shall use their best efforts to engage directly to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement and engage in good faith negotiations which shall be a condition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.

### 13.2 Binding Arbitration ###

If the parties do not reach an agreed upon solution within a period of 30 days from the time informal dispute resolution under the Initial Dispute Resolution provision begins, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims, subject to the terms set forth below. Specifically, all claims arising out of or relating to these Terms (including their formation, performance and breach), the parties’ relationship with each other and/or your use of the Service shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with the provisions of its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the supplementary procedures for consumer related disputes of the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”), excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions.

The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms are void or voidable, or whether a claim is subject to arbitration. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator’s award shall be written, and binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.

The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.

### 13.3 Location ###

Binding arbitration shall take place in California. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in Los Angeles county, California in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.

### 13.4 Class Action Waiver ###

The parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. YOU AND ClearCoin AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.

### 13.5 Exception - Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court Claims ###

Notwithstanding the parties’ decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring an action in state or federal court to protect its intellectual property rights (“intellectual property rights” means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights). Either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court’s jurisdiction.

The Terms and the relationship between you and ClearCoin shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to conflict of law provisions

## 14. Ad Blocking & Replacing Tools ##

The ClearCoin Extension is designed to help the global media & ad industry recover lost revenues due to ad blockers. Instead of just blocking the ad, we replace the ad on the page and allow the publisher to gain back revenue they otherwise would have lost to an ad blocker. The publisher is eligible to claim the XCLR tokens that go with the associated ad that was served on their site. The user is will also earn a share of the XCLR tokens from the ad being served on the publisher. This allows the users and publisher to share in newly created value for the media and ad industry.

### 14.1 Functionality of Ad Blocking & Replacing ###

The ClearCoin Extension is provided "as is" and on an "as available" basis. Your use of the ClearCoin Extension is at your own risk. Oath Capital, Inc. makes no warranty or condition that ClearCoin will meet your requirements or be uninterrupted, timely, secure or error-free:

Oath Capital, Inc.  makes no warranty or condition that all ads will be replaced.

You acknowledge and understand that the filters used may occasionally lead to blocked content. 

This is an unwanted side effect of some filters and cannot be completely avoided.

ClearCoin uses Filter lists. Filter lists are essentially an extensive set of rules that tell ClearCoin where to block and replace an ad. ClearCoin has little to no influence on those filter lists.

In the case that you detect any defect or incorrect blocking, including the blocking of content, inform us as soon as possible by contacting [help@clearcoin.co](help@clearcoin.co).

### 14.2 Non-permitted use of ClearCoin's Extension ###

Please note that some website owners may not permit ad-blocking users to view their website. That must be respected, especially in the following cases:

You must not use ClearCoin on websites where you have agreed not to use it, i.e. by agreeing to Terms of Services on the respective website, not to use any ad blockers.

You are not permitted to use ClearCoin in connection with any tools to circumvent technological measures that effectively control access to websites.

## 15 General Information ##

### 15.1 Entire Agreement ###
